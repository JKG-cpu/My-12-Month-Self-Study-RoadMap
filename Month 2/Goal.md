# Goal for Month 2
## Algorithms & Problem Solving

### Focus Areas

1. Searching algorithms
   - Linear search
   - Binary search
2. Sorting algorithms
   - Understanding how sorting works
   - Implementing basic sorting algorithms
3. Recursion basics
   - Understanding how recursive calls work
   - Base cases vs recursive cases
4. Logical problem solving
   - Breaking problems into steps
   - Thinking before coding
5. Coding challenge practice
   - Applying algorithms to small problems

***🎯 Goal: Build strong logic and problem-solving skills.***

### Purpose of This Month

Month 1 focused on **how data is stored**.  
Month 2 focuses on **how data is processed**.

Instead of learning new tools or frameworks, I will:
- Learn how algorithms work internally
- Apply them to data structures I already understand
- Focus on reasoning, not speed

---

### What I Will Be Working On

- Writing searching algorithms that operate on lists and dictionaries
- Writing sorting algorithms manually to understand how ordering works
- Practicing recursion with small, controlled examples
- Solving simple algorithmic problems using Python
- Analyzing my own algorithm code using Big-O notation

---

### Big-O Focus for Month 2

I will continue practicing Big-O notation, with more emphasis on:

- **O(1)** — constant time
- **O(n)** — linear time
- **O(log n)** — logarithmic time (divide and conquer)
- **O(n²)** — quadratic time (nested loops)

I will focus on:
- Best-case vs worst-case performance
- Why some slower algorithms are still useful
- When algorithm choice matters vs when it doesn’t

---

### What This Month Is *Not* About

- Not about building large applications
- Not about UI or design
- Not about frameworks
- Not about memorizing algorithms without understanding them

The goal is **understanding**, not completion speed.

---

### Success Criteria (How I Know I’m Done)

By the end of Month 2, I should be able to:

- Explain how linear and binary search work in my own words
- Explain why binary search requires sorted data
- Implement at least one sorting algorithm from scratch
- Write and explain a simple recursive function
- Analyze the time complexity of my own algorithms
- Approach coding problems more logically and systematically

### Mindset Reminder

> This month is about learning how to think through problems.  
> Struggling is expected. Understanding is the goal.
