Personal Dev Utility (PDU)

A lightweight, terminal-based Python tool designed to help me stay organized,
review core concepts, and track my progress while following my self-study roadmap.

This tool is intentionally simple, local-only, and built to grow over time.

Current Features (V1–V2 Scope)

1. Review Notes (by Topic)
- Reads structured notes from a local notes file
- Displays available topics (e.g. Big-O Notation, Data Structures)
- Allows selecting a topic to view only the relevant section
- Used for quick refreshers without rereading entire notes

2. Create New Log
- Creates a new daily log file automatically (named by date)
- Auto-formats basic information such as:
  - Date
  - Day
  - Focus / notes section
- Displays the log in the terminal with line numbers
- Allows editing specific lines directly from the command line
- Saves changes automatically
- Also mirrors content to a temporary file for quick viewing

3. Progress & Goal Tracker
- Maintains a separate tracker file
- Tracks:
  - Current goals
  - Last active date
  - Study streak
- Allows:
  - Viewing goals
  - Adding new goals
  - Updating progress
- Designed to encourage consistency without pressure

Planned Feature (Optional / Later)

4. Python File Generator
- Creates a new Python file with a basic structure
- Supports:
  - Adding common imports
  - Creating a class stub
  - Adding a main guard (if __name__ == "__main__")
- Used to quickly start small scripts without boilerplate repetition

Design Principles
- No external libraries
- No networking or automation
- Simple file-based storage
- Readable, maintainable code
- Built for long-term personal use, not performance or polish

Purpose
This tool exists to support learning, reflection, and consistency —
not to replace learning or automate thinking.
