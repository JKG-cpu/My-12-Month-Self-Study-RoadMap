# Daily Time Commitment Plan
### Self-Study Journey (Software Engineering + Cybersecurity)

This document explains how I manage my daily learning time while balancing school, life, and long-term goals.
The focus is **consistency, sustainability, and hands-on learning**.

---

## 🎯 Daily Time Target

- **Minimum:** 30 minutes
- **Ideal:** 45–60 minutes
- **Busy days:** 0 minutes is acceptable

> The goal is not perfection — it’s consistency over weeks and months.

---

## ⏱️ Time Split (Most Important Rule)

**Default split:**
- **40%** learning / reading / watching
- **60%** doing (coding, labs, system setup)

**Why this works:**
- Passive learning doesn’t stick
- Real skill comes from hands-on practice
- Building > watching

---

## 📅 Session Examples

### ⏳ 30-Minute Session
- 10 minutes — learning (docs, short video, notes)
- 20 minutes — doing (coding, Linux, labs)

> If time is short, I prioritize **doing**.

---

### ⏳ 45-Minute Session
- 15–20 minutes — learning
- 25–30 minutes — doing

---

### ⏳ 60-Minute Session
- 20 minutes — learning
- 40 minutes — doing
- Optional: last 5 minutes writing what I learned

---

## 🛠️ What Counts as “Learning”

- Reading official documentation
- Watching a short technical video
- Reading a book chapter or guide
- Reviewing notes or concepts

---

## 💻 What Counts as “Doing”

- Writing or refactoring code
- Solving coding challenges
- Configuring Linux systems
- Breaking and fixing lab environments (legally)
- Building or improving projects

---

## 📆 Weekly Expectations

- **3–5 study days per week** is ideal
- **1–2 rest days** with no guilt
- Progress is measured **weekly**, not daily

---

## 🧠 Burnout Prevention Rules

**I avoid:**
- Studying late every night
- Sacrificing sleep or school grades
- Comparing my progress to others

**I focus on:**
- Sustainable habits
- Learning for understanding
- Enjoying the process

---

## 🚀 What Success Looks Like

### After 1 Month
- More comfort using Linux
- Small scripts or configurations working
- Less copying, more reasoning

### After 1 Year
- Strong foundations in CS and security
- Real projects with documentation
- A clear advantage going into college

---

## ✅ Core Principle

> **Consistency beats intensity.**
> Small daily effort over years compounds into real expertise.

*This plan will evolve as my skills grow.*
