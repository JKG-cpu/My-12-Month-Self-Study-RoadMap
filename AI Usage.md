# AI Usage Policy

This document explains **how I use AI tools** during my self-study journey in *software engineering and cybersecurity*.

The goal is to **learn deeply, build real skills, and stay honest** about my work.

---

## Core Principle

> **AI is a tool to support my learning — not a replacement for thinking.**

I always attempt problems **on my own first** before using AI assistance.

---

## What I Use AI For

### Learning & Understanding

- Explaining concepts I don't fully understand
- Clarifying documentation or terminology
- Answering "why" questions
- Providing alternative explanations

### Debugging & Review

- Explaining error messages **after I try**
- Reviewing my code for mistakes or improvements
- Pointing out potential bugs or edge cases

### Code Improvement (Not Creation)

- Suggesting refactors
- Improving readability
- Identifying security concerns
- Recommending best practices

### Planning & Documentation

- Brainstorming project ideas
- Helping outline project structure
- Reviewing documentation for clarity
- Improving wording (not technical content)

### Learning Acceleration

- Suggesting resources
- Explaining how tools work conceptually
- Comparing approaches

---

## What I Do NOT Use AI For

### Solving Problems for Me

- Writing full solutions before I attempt them
- Completing labs or challenges without my effort
- Generating answers I don't understand

### Blind Copying

- Copy-pasting AI-generated code into projects
- Submitting code I cannot explain line-by-line

### Security Misuse

- Attacking real systems or networks
- Generating exploits for unauthorized targets
- Bypassing security without permission

### Academic Dishonesty

- Using AI to complete school assignments without permission
- Misrepresenting AI-assisted work as fully original

---

## My AI Usage Rules

Before asking AI, I ask myself:
- Have I tried for **at least 10–15 minutes**?
- Do I understand the problem?
- Am I asking *why* instead of just *how*?

If the answer is **yes**, AI is allowed.

---

## Transparency

- AI assistance is allowed in this repository
- The final understanding, decisions, and implementations are **my own**
- I take responsibility for all code and explanations here

---

## Long-Term Goal

My goal is to become an engineer who can:
- Solve problems independently
- Use AI effectively and ethically
- Understand systems deeply
- Explain and defend my work clearly

AI helps me move faster — **not think for me**.

*This policy may evolve as my skills grow.*
