# Goal for Month 1
## Computer Science Foundations

### Focus Areas

1. Data structures (lists, stacks, queues, dictionaries)
2. Big‑O notation & time complexity
3. Writing clean, readable Python code
4. Analyze my own code for time complexity
5. Practice explaining design decisions simply

***🎯 Goal: Think like a software engineer, not just a coder.***

### Needs

*PS This is provided by AI and tips from other people*

For 2. (Big-O), focus on understanding how runtime grows as input size increases:

- O(1) => Constant Time

- O(n) => Linear Time

- O(n^2) => Nested Loops

- O(log n) => divide and conquer idea

*I will most likely be adding onto this*
